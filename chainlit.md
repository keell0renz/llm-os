# Welcome to Code Agent v1

This agent, built with [LangCode](https://github.com/keell0renz/langcode), a developer-friendly API for interactive Python code execution, can execute Python code in a stateful Jupyter Notebook with full access to your system, The Internet, and output images generated inside Jupyter environment (ex. Matplotlib plot image).

Please, set up `.env` file in the directory so agent knows additional details about you and your preferences.
